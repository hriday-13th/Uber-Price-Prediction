# Uber Ride Price Prediction

This notebook aims to predict the prices of Uber bookings based on data from the [Uber Ride Price Prediction dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kushsheth/uber-ride-price-prediction) on Kaggle.

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that can predict Uber ride prices based on a variety of factors such as pickup and dropoff locations, time of day, and other ride details. To achieve this, we use several Python libraries for data processing and machine learning.

## Libraries Used
The following libraries were utilized in this notebook:

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Numpy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
- **Geopy**: For geospatial calculations, specifically distance calculations between coordinates.
- **DateTime**: For handling and processing date and time information.

## Modeling Approach
The model employs a `ColumnTransformer` along with an ensemble learning method to predict Uber ride prices. The steps include:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and transforming the data, handling missing values, and preparing features.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features from existing data (e.g., extracting date and time features, calculating distances using geospatial data).
3. **Modeling**: Using an ensemble model to capture complex relationships in the data and improve prediction accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is available on Kaggle: [Uber Ride Price Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kushsheth/uber-ride-price-prediction).

## Conclusion
By using a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and ensemble learning, this notebook predicts the prices of Uber rides based on historical booking data.
